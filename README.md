## Features
- Calculate heterozygosity for individuals
- Calculate hybrid index for individuals
- Analyze genetic variation within bat species populations
- Facilitate speciation genomics research in bats

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - scipy

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speciation-genomics-bat.git
